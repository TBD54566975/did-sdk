# Examples

In this folder, there are examples of how to run specific 
core TBD structs via a command. These examples intend to be verbose 
in comments and by design values clarity and information richness
over any other concerns.

To use, navigate to the folder:

i.e 

``` sh
cd did
```

Then you should be able to invoke the example via: 

``` sh
go run main.go
```

Review the source code for instructions and additional information.
